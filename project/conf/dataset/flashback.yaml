#! NB. Everything here concerns downloading and partitioning the four datasets (cities) only.

# Where to download and store raw data (all four cities will be downloaded)
raw_dataset_dir: ./data/flashback/raw_data

# Where to save postprocessed raw data to.
# Directory structure looks like
#    postprocessed_partitions_root / chosen_city / partition_type / client_x.txt
# where chosen_city in ("CAL", "NY", "PHO", "SIN")
#   and partition_type in ("centralised", "fed_natural")
#
# Train and test splits are created at runtime, not stored statically
# to reuse as much of Flashback's code as possible.
postprocessed_partitions_root: ./data/flashback/partition

# Sequence length; k in the Flashback paper
# This is the maximum length of the input to the model
# I.e. the maximum number of historical checkins we look at, when we predict the next checkin
sequence_length: 20

# Where all the partitions are stored. Selection of subfolders is done using yaml in task (city and partition_type fields)
